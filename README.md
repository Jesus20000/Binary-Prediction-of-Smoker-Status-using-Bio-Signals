# Binary-Prediction-of-Smoker-Status-using-Bio-Signals
The project aimed to develop a machine learning model for predicting smoking status based on various health-related features. The dataset included information such as age, weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. The goal was to build a model that could accurately classify individuals as smokers or non-smokers.
